# UNITY PROJECT `PUZZLE``

## Description

This is a small project for unity, the goal for this project was to create a playable character that will be able to:

- Look around with the mouse, move and jump with wasd and space bar.
- When clicking grab an object with attached script ```Interactable.cs```, grabbed objects will move towards the player and stay in front of the player.
- Grabbed objects will still be affected by physics, if they are too far away from the player they will fall since they will be no longer grabbed by the player.
- Grabbed objects became semi transparent so the player can actually see while holding the object.
- Since the objects are still affected by physics it is possible to throw them.
